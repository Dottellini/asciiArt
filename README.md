# asciiArt
Creates terminal ASCII Art from Images

## Usage
Start the program by opening a console inside the project and entering
```bash
$ java main
```

You will then be asked to enter an image.
You can either add an image into the **/images** folder and then just enter the images' name here 
(Dont forget the filetype at the end) or use the full path to the image.

After that you can resize the Image to create a smaller ASCII result by entering a number. 
Only enter one integer value (e.g. `500`). This will make the width or height (depending on whats larger) be 500px max. 

The Scaling of the image wont change.
